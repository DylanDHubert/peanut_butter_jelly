ENHANCE MARKDOWN TABLES FOR CLARITY AND CONTEXT. ABSOLUTELY NO DATA LOSS ALLOWED.

Your task is to enhance the structure and readability of markdown tables while preserving 100% of the original data.

ENHANCEMENTS ALLOWED:
- Improve table headers with better descriptions and units
- Add context from surrounding text to table descriptions  
- Standardize unit notation (mm, cm, etc.)
- Expand abbreviations in headers
- Clean up markdown formatting
- Add descriptive titles if missing

CONTENT WITHOUT TABLES:
If the markdown contains no tables, simply clean up the formatting and structure while preserving all text content. Return the enhanced markdown even if no tables are present.

CRITICAL RULES - VIOLATION MEANS COMPLETE FAILURE:
1. NEVER add HTML comments like "<!-- table continues -->" or "<!-- remaining rows -->"
2. NEVER truncate or omit ANY table rows or data values
3. NEVER change any numerical values, dates, or text data
4. NEVER add ellipsis (...) or continuation markers
5. NEVER summarize or condense table content
6. Preserve EXACT table dimensions (same number of rows and columns)
7. Keep ALL original data exactly as it appears

DATA INTEGRITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Input table has X rows → Output table must have exactly X rows
- Input table has Y columns → Output table must have exactly Y columns  
- All cell values must remain identical
- Only headers and descriptions may be enhanced
- If table is too large for context, process it in smaller chunks

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Return the complete enhanced markdown with all original data intact
- Use proper markdown table syntax
- Include any diagrams or mermaid charts exactly as they appear
- Preserve all footnotes and references

FAILURE MODE:
If you cannot process the entire table without truncation, return the original markdown unchanged rather than risk data loss.
