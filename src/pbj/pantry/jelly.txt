Convert enhanced markdown to structured JSON. NO DATA LOSS.

- Extract all table rows, preserve all numbers, booleans, and relationships.
- Use enhanced headers, units, and context for columns.
- Add technical summary, keywords, and table descriptions.
- Output valid JSON: all input rows must appear in output, no truncation.

CRITICAL: Never add HTML comments or continuation markers. Extract complete table structures exactly as they appear in the input.

INPUT CONTEXT:
- Enhanced markdown with improved headers and integrated context
- Tables contain boolean values (TRUE/FALSE, YES/NO) from visual marker conversion
- Content includes technical specifications, measurements, and structured datasets
- Headers have been enhanced with units and descriptive names

EXTRACTION OBJECTIVES:
1. CREATE structured JSON optimized for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
2. PRESERVE all tabular data with complete fidelity
3. GENERATE meaningful summaries and keywords for searchability
4. MAINTAIN technical precision and measurement accuracy
5. STRUCTURE data for efficient downstream processing

JSON OUTPUT SPECIFICATION:

  "title": "Document/Page title based on content",
  "summary": "Technical summary highlighting key specifications and data (X sentences)",
  "keywords": ["technical_term_1", "specification_2", "measurement_3", "feature_4", "application_5"],
  "tables": [
    {
      "table_id": "table_N",
      "title": "Descriptive table title from enhanced headers",
      "description": "Technical description explaining table purpose and context",
      "columns": ["Enhanced Column Names (with units and context)"],

    }
  ]
}

EXTRACTION STANDARDS:

DATA PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:
- EXTRACT ALL table rows without truncation or omission
- PRESERVE exact numerical values (measurements, specifications, tolerances)
- MAINTAIN boolean values exactly as converted (TRUE/FALSE, YES/NO)
- RETAIN complete technical relationships and data dependencies
- ENSURE X input rows result in X output rows

CONTENT ENHANCEMENT RULES:
- USE enhanced column names with integrated units and context
- GENERATE technical summaries highlighting key specifications
- CREATE searchable keywords including technical terms and measurements
- ADD meaningful table descriptions based on enhanced context
- CLASSIFY data types and technical categories accurately

QUALITY VALIDATION:
- Verify complete data extraction across all N tables
- Confirm numerical precision matches input specifications
- Validate boolean consistency from visual marker conversion
- Ensure technical terminology accuracy throughout
- Check metadata completeness and accuracy

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Zero data loss: every row must be extracted
- Numerical fidelity: preserve all measurements and specifications exactly
- Boolean integrity: maintain TRUE/FALSE values from marker conversion
- Enhanced structure: utilize improved headers and context
- RAG optimization: structure for efficient retrieval and generation

TECHNICAL FOCUS AREAS:
- Specifications and tolerances
- Compatibility matrices and boolean tables
- Measurement data with units
- Performance characteristics
- Technical classifications and categories

OUTPUT INSTRUCTION:
Return valid JSON with complete data extraction in the specified formatting.
