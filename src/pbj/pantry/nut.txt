Extract complete tabular datasets with maximum data integrity.

PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Identify and convert ALL visual markers to boolean values (TRUE/FALSE or YES/NO)
- Capture complete data ranges, extending beyond visual table boundaries when patterns continue
- Consolidate tables with matching column structures but different ranges into unified datasets
- Add descriptive range columns when merging related tables
- Preserve every numerical value and data relationship exactly

COLUMN DETECTION INTELLIGENCE:
- When you encounter X columns with no names or placeholder names (e.g., "Column A", "Col 1", "X", "Y"):
  * Look ahead in the document for definitions, legends, or explanations
  * If X items are listed later that match the number of unnamed columns, these are likely the column headers
  * Map the unnamed columns to their discovered definitions
  * Preserve the original structure while adding discovered column names
- For tables with mixed named/unnamed columns, maintain all relationships
- When column definitions are found later, update the table structure accordingly

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Zero data loss or truncation
- Consistent boolean conversion across all visual indicators
- Optimal table structure for downstream processing
- Complete coverage of all technical content and specifications
