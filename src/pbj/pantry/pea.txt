Extract ALL tabular data with complete fidelity. NO DATA LOSS.

CORE: Extract tables, preserve exact values, convert visual markers to TRUE/FALSE, merge identical structures, detect unnamed columns.

VISUAL MARKERS: •✓●→ convert to TRUE, empty cells to FALSE.

COLUMN DETECTION: Map unnamed columns (A,B,X,Y) to definitions found later in document.

REQUIREMENTS: Zero truncation, exact numerical values, complete relationships, full data ranges.

TABLE EXTRACTION STANDARDS:
- For visual markers (bullets •, checkmarks ✓, filled shapes, symbols): convert to TRUE/YES
- For empty/unmarked cells: convert to FALSE/NO  
- For tables with identical structure but different ranges: merge into single comprehensive table
- Add range columns (e.g., "Size Range") when consolidating related tables
- Prioritize data accuracy over visual formatting

COLUMN DETECTION INTELLIGENCE:
- When encountering X columns with no names or placeholder names (e.g., "Column A", "Col 1", "X", "Y"):
  * Look ahead in the document for definitions, legends, or explanations
  * If X items are listed later that match the number of unnamed columns, these are likely the column headers
  * Map the unnamed columns to their discovered definitions
  * Preserve the original structure while adding discovered column names
- For tables with mixed named/unnamed columns, maintain all relationships
- When column definitions are found later, update the table structure accordingly

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Preserve all numerical data exactly as shown
- Maintain complete column-to-row relationships
- Extract full data ranges across visual boundaries
- Ensure no data truncation or omission 
- Adapt table structure when column definitions are discovered
